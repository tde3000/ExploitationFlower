ExploitationFlower
==================


This is supposed to be a site that rates businesses according to how good they exploit thier workers.

Basically, each business has a list of ways it exploits its workers. Giving them their so called "rights" is a waste of money. With each exploit it gets more capitalist and efficient. A business with no exploits will have shriveled flowers, so people know they're social-democrats and are the reason for poverty.

TODO: 

* a page for each business
* list of exploits (including scores)
* user reviews of businesses
* user auth
